# S.E.R.F. Board (Script Effective Responses Fast)
A web application designed to assist people with writing effective responses to high conflict messages that they have received.  [Bill Eddy's BIFF concept] (Brief, Informative, Friendly, Firm) is at the center of this little tool. So take BIFF and your S.E.R.F. Board for a spin!<br>

## Motivation:
[Bill Eddy's BIFF concept] is extremely effective in assisting people with their responses to high conflict, rude, inflamatory or just plain nasty messages that they receive.  My motivation was to build a tool that you could use on the go or at your desk before responding to an email, a social post or anything else that 'pushed your button'.
