# S.E.R.F. Board (Script Effective Responses Fast) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/bryanspearman/biff-assist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/bryanspearman/biff-assist)

A web application designed to assist people with writing effective responses to high conflict messages that they have received. [Bill Eddy's BIFF concept] (Brief, Informative, Friendly, Firm) is at your finger tips to keep you on track. So it's time to learn to S.E.R.F.!<br>
[Try it out]

## Motivation:

[Bill Eddy's BIFF concept] is extremely effective in assisting people with their responses to high conflict, rude, inflamatory or just plain nasty messages that they receive. My motivation was to build a tool that you could use on the go or at your desk before responding to an email, a social post or anything else that 'pushed your button'.
